Run `seance ctl whoami` (your pane and circle) and `seance ctl skill` (the \
engagement protocol: driving sibling panes, talking to other circles, status, \
scratchpads, file panes), and follow that protocol from now on. The skill ships \
with seance, so it is always current; re-run it after a context reset.

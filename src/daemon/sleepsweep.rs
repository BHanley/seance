//! Automatic sleep: Claude panes nobody has touched in a while stop costing
//! RAM (12h by default; `seance-auto-sleep-idle` in terminal.conf).
//!
//! Deliberately conservative. It only sleeps a pane that can be woken back
//! exactly (`Engine::pane_restorable`: an agent pane whose conversation is on
//! disk, or Claude hosted in a shell with a session record), never one that
//! is busy, waiting on the human, holding queued tasks or focused, and never
//! in a circle listed in `seance-auto-sleep-skip`. Idle is human input and
//! the pane's busy changes, not screen output, which a Claude status line
//! never stops making. Anything addressed to a sleeping pane wakes it.
//!
//! Manual sleep (`seance ctl sleep`, right-click → sleep) still sleeps whole
//! circles.
